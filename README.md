# Obsidian Sample Plugin

This is a sample plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

This project uses TypeScript to provide type checking and documentation.
The repo depends on the latest plugin API (obsidian.d.ts) in TypeScript Definition format, which contains TSDoc comments describing what it does.

This sample plugin demonstrates some of the basic functionality the plugin API can do.

- Adds a ribbon icon, which shows a Notice when clicked.
- Adds a command "Open Sample Modal" which opens a Modal.
- Adds a plugin setting tab to the settings page.
- Registers a global click event and output 'click' to the console.
- Registers a global interval which logs 'setInterval' to the console.

## How to use

- Clone this repo.
- Make sure your NodeJS is at least v16 (`node --version`).
- `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies.
- `npm run dev` to start compilation in watch mode.

## Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-id/`.

## Improve code quality with eslint (optional)

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a tool that analyzes your code to quickly find problems. You can run ESLint against your plugin to find common bugs and ways to improve your code.
- To use eslint with this project, make sure to install eslint from terminal:
  - `npm install -g eslint`
- To use eslint to analyze this project use this command:
  - `eslint main.ts`
  - eslint will then create a report with suggestions for code improvement by file and line number.
- If your source code is in a folder, such as `src`, you can use eslint with this command to analyze all files in that folder:
  - `eslint .\src\`
